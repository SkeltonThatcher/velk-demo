velk-demo
=========

Vagrant deployed ELK (elasticsearch, logstash and kibana) demonstrator.

Guidance

Install the latest VirtualBox, and Vagrant, this should be easy, ymmv.

1. Create a directory under which to keep vagrant configs
2. Clone the repo, we assume you know how to do this as you're on github reading this....
3. Start the machine, 'vagrant up' in the directory

Sit back for a few minutes depending on your net connection speed (fingers crossed).

A successful build (i.e. deployment and provision) resutlts in being able browse kibana and elasticsearch, 
the setup captures local syslog, messages and nginx logs (from the vm)

Notes

1. Credentials to login the box - login : vagrant , password : vagrant
2. Login method 1 : vagrant ssh
3. Login method 2 : ssh -p 2222 vagrant@localhost

Access the platform using the following URLs

        Elasticsearch check http://localhost:9200/_plugin/kopf/
        ELK GUI check : http://yourinternal.virtualbox.ip/

N.B. You may have to login to the box to check the IP address of the interface which is serving ELK.
